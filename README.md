The code exists as 4 notebooks all within the 'notebooks' subdirectory.

* nfl_draft_data_processing.ipynb - This notebook combines, transforms and normalizes the raw_data to create the data within transformed_data
* nfl_draft_factor_analysis.ipynb - This notebook contains the code to generate the PCA and factor analysis outputs used within the reports
* nfl_draft_regression_analysis.ipynb - This notebook contains the code to generate the linear regression analysis outputs used within the reports
* nfl_draft_eda.ipynb - This notebook contains some additional analysis not included within the report but used to understand the data

## Reports
